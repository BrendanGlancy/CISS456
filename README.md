## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, G++)
- Make (optional for easier building)

### Installing Make

- **Windows**: Install "GNU Make for Windows" or use Chocolatey package manager:

  ```powershell
  choco install make
  ```

- **Mac**: Make is included with Xcode Command Line Tools:

  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

- **Linux**: Install Make using the system's package manager, e.g., for Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install build-essential
  ```

### Building and Running

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrendanGlancy/CISS456.git
   cd CISS456
   ```

2. Build the application:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   *If you don't have Make, compile using your C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ -o pdr_app src/*.cpp`

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   ./pdr_app
   ```
